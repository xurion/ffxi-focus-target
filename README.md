# Commands

## //ft

Toggles the focus on the current target. If there is no target, any existing focus is removed.

It can be helpful to setup a bind for this. To match the ALT+F bind from FFXIV:

```
bind !f ft
```

## //ft pos <axis> <pos>

Set the position on either the x or y axis.

Example: `//ft pos y 200`

## //ft help

Displays command help.
